# RoiTracking
This plugin presents a possibility to track interesting points where gimbal is looking to.

Shortkeys:
- Alt + L - add the point where gimbal is looking to, to the tracking list and start loiter around it.
- Alt + T - just add the the point where gimbal is looking to, to the tracking list.
- Alt + R - resume loiter around the last point.

After point is added to the tracking list, that point will be marked on the map exactly there where gimbal was looking to:
